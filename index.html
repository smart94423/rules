    <h1>Open Source Forum Rules &#x1F6E1;</h1>

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; for problems unrelated to our tools.</h2>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="quote">We have this error coming from tool X, can you help?</blockquote>
      Ask tool X instead of asking us.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="quote">Our app is broken and we don't know why, can you help?</blockquote>
      Only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to our tools.
    </div>

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; without having tried, <i>really</i> tried.</h2>

    <p>
      The golden rule here is to <b>try, reasarch, try, research, and try & research again</b> before asking us. You
      should spend <i>at least</i> a couple of hours on <i>one</i> specific problem before asking for help. If you are
      well versed with our tools then, and only then, can you reduce your research time before asking us.
    </p>

    <p>
      Only <i>expert</i> users can ask after only 10 minutes of research. If you are not well versed with our tools the
      answer is the vast majority of the time: <b>read more documentation, and try longer</b>.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="info">
      That said, <b>criticism is more than welcome</b> and our tools should be ergonomic. Let us know if you believe
      that a particular aspect of our tool is not user friendly and we'll fix it.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>&#x2705; Asking for help &mdash; you did your homework.</h2>

    <blockquote class="quote">
      We have this problem. We tried this, that, and that other thing, but without success. Can you help?
    </blockquote>
    We can tell you first tried to solve your problem on your own before asking us &mdash; you did your homework
    &#x1F44C;. We are happy to help.

    <h2>&#x2705; Everything else is welcome.</h2>
