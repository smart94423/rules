    <h1>Rules &#x1F6E1;</h1>

    <p>Welcome! We <span style="font-size: 1.2em">&#x1F49B;</span> conversations.</p>

    <p>
      In order to keep our Discord/GitHub <b>constructive</b> <span style="font-size: 1.2em">&#x1F4AA;</span>, we ask
      you to carefully read <b>following rules</b> <span style="font-size: 1.4em">&#x1F6E1;</span>, thanks!
    </p>

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; for problems unrelated to our tools.</h2>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="bad">
        <span class="quote">We have a problem with tool X, can you help?</span>
      </blockquote>
      Ask tool X instead of asking us.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="bad">
        <span class="quote">Our app doesn't work and we don't know why, can you help?</span>
      </blockquote>
      Ask us <b>only if you have evidence</b> that your problem is related to our tools.
    </div>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="good">
        <span class="quote">Your tool currently behaves like this, but it's problematic because...</span>
      </blockquote>
      Your prolem is clearly related to our tool <span style="font-size: 1.2em">&#x2705;</span>.

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; without having tried, <i>really</i> tried.</h2>

    <p>
      The golden rule here is to <b>try, research, try, research, and try & research again(!)</b> before asking for
      help.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="info">
      If you are not well-versed with our tools then
      <b>you'll most likely find a solution by reading more documentation and trying longer</b>.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      <b>If you are a junior developer</b>, you should spend <i>at least</i> something like <b>a couple of hours</b> on
      <i>one</i> specific problem before asking for help.
    </p>

    <p><b>If you are a senior developer</b>, you can reduce that time to something like <b>one hour</b>.</p>

    <p><b>If you are well-versed with our tools</b>, you can reduce that time to something like <b>10 minutes</b>.</p>

    <blockquote class="info">
      That said, <b>criticism is more than welcome: our tools should be ergonomic</b>. Let us know if you believe that a
      particular aspect of our tool is not user friendly and we'll fix it.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>&#x2705; Asking for help &mdash; you did your homework.</h2>

    <!-- prettier-ignore -->
    <blockquote class="quote">We have this problem. We tried this, that, and that other thing, but without success. Can you help?</blockquote>

    We can tell you first tried to solve your problem on your own before asking us &mdash; you did your homework
    <span style="font-size: 1.2em">&#x1F44C;</span>. We are happy to help.

    <h2>&#x2705; Everything else is welcome.</h2>
