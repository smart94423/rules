    <h1>Open Source Software Forum Rules &#x1F6E1;</h1>

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; for problems unrelated to our tools.</h2>

    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="quote">We have this error coming from tool X, can you help?</blockquote>
      Ask tool X instead of asking us.
    </div>
    <div class="p">
      <blockquote class="quote">Our app is broken and we don't know why, can you help?</blockquote>
      Only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to our tools.
    </div>

    <h2>&#x274C; Asking for help &mdash; without having tried, <i>really</i> tried.</h2>

    <p>
      The golden rule here is to <b>try, try, and try again</b> before asking us. You should spend <i>at least</i> a
      couple of hours on your specific problem before asking us.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="info">
      That said, <b>criticism is more than welcome</b> and our tools should be ergonomic. Let us know about paper cuts
      and we'll fix them.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>&#x2705; Everything else is welcome.</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Bug Reports</b>.</li>
      <blockquote class="quote">We have this error coming from your tool.</blockquote>
      Give us the full error stack and we'll fix the bug.
      <li><b>Feature Requests</b>.</li>

          We have this problem. We tried this, that, and that other thing, but without success. Can you help?
